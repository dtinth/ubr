## Disclaimer

This app will request an Uber on your behalf.
You will pay for the ride initiated by this application.

While I strive to make this tool as stable and bug-free as possible,
I could not make any guarantee that it does not contain a bug that may cause unintended requests to be sent, which may lead to monetary loss.
Therefore, please this tool at your own risk.

## Installation

```
gem install ubr
```

## Usage

To keep the Uber system safe, only an application's developer will be able to
request a ride until the app is approved by Uber.

My original `ubr` application has not been approved yet.
Therefore, you need to [create your own application](https://developer.uber.com/apps).

Set the callback URL to `https://dtinth.github.io/ubr/callback.html`.
As of writing, it is OK to keep the webhook URLs blank.
